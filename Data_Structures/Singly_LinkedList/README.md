# Singly LinkedList

### Overview
This is a singly linkedlist that does insert, print, find and delete. The time complexity of insert O(1) but adding new node as head and setting the previous head as next node. This implementation uses this two article from [Python Central](https://www.pythoncentral.io/) as a reference:
* [Print and Insert](https://www.pythoncentral.io/singly-linked-list-insert-node/)
* [Find and Remove](https://www.pythoncentral.io/find-remove-node-linked-lists/)
