# Binary Search Tree

### Overview
This is a binary search tree that does not allow duplicates. This implementation uses this two repo as a reference:
* [joeyajames](https://github.com/joeyajames/Python/tree/master/Trees) bst implementation for the overall data structure
* [vprusso](https://github.com/vprusso/youtube_tutorials/tree/master/data_structures/trees/binary_trees) for the level order traversal and queue


### ToDo:
Still need to add remove node
