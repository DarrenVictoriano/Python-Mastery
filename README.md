# Python-Mastery

### Overview
This is my personal notes for learning Python Programming language. This include Language Idioms, Data Structures, Algorithms or anything that I find useful/important to know.

The Contents of this repo are the compilation of all books/articles I read to help me learn the language. I will try my best to cite all the links of the articles or title of the book.
